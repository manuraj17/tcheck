# TCheck

TCheck helps you to check if your rails rendered page has any translation
issues. It will show you the number of errors and the errored text with the
expected key value in the translation file.

Currently, it supports only for the pages that are rendered from rails supported
templates and those which use rails builtin I18n translation. Nothing else is
supported as of now.

This is a pre-beta version in experimental phase, so please be aware that there
could be breakages.
